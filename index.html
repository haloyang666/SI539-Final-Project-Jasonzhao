          <p>
            I collaborate with ecologists, community organizers, and policy researchers 
            to understand the full life of post-industrial sites. Together, we transform 
            polluted ground, rebuild local economies, and restore cultural dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each project is treated as both a design problem and a social question: 
            what futures become possible if we repair what has been extracted, buried, or ignored?

                A four-phase remediation plan for Navajo uranium lands combines

                rebuild health, memory, and economic stability.

                In a coastal energy landscape, industrial discharge becomes a resource:

                spaces that re-stitch ecology and everyday life.

            This ongoing research traces how maps, simulations, and policy documents 
            frame landscapes as either sacrifice zones or sites of possibility. 
            By re-drawing these territories, I ask how design can redistribute risk 
            and repair.

              I focus on sites marked by environmental trauma – mining, toxic industry,

              Each project starts with mapping and listening. I work with technical 
              guidelines, local knowledge, and ecological timelines to define 
              interventions that are realistic, phased, and maintainable.

              Drawings and models are rooted in data, but they also test “what if” 
              scenarios. Speculation helps to reveal invisible power structures and 
              open up alternative futures.
